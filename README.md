This code does NOT work now, before whatsapp was updated, the time when you needed to have internet connection on you mobile to use whatsapp on computer, It used to work.

I have used selenium for web automation

The msedgedriver.exe file in this folder would be outdate, so you will have to download the latest file from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/   and replace it with the old one.

Your Microsoft Edge Browser must be updated to the latest version too

*In the Whatsapp_Sender.py File, you have to FIND AND REPLACE +91 with the country calling code of your country (the thing in the starting of a phone number) +91 is the country code of my country, thus it is +91 in the code

As you have probably guessed, Whatsapp_Sender.py is the main code.

Whatsapp_Updater.exe is the exe file made by .py file of whatsapp updater

whatsapp_updater.py file updates the application, if I launch an update, to understand this updater, you should know the basics of FIREBASE.
